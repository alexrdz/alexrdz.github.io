Changing course now has to do with a few simple facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My regular 9to5 jobs keep my pretty busy that I don’t do much freelance work anymore. And because of that, I don’t have much of a portfolio these days. I don’t feel like having 2 or 3 small projects as a portfolio really touches on the experience I have or reflects the work I’m doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because I have full-time jobs as a developer, I am not really seeking out potential clients so my portfolio is not high priority right now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any time I have for freelancing is spent on a joint venture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech-mex.io&quot;&gt;Tech-Mex&lt;/a&gt;, I have going with my friend, George  Ramirez.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel like if I do seek employment, prospective employers would rather see code samples and/or thoughts/writings on front end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly sure yet how much time I plan to devote to blogging. At the very least, I hope to motivate myself enough to keep this as a learning journal, chronicling any new bits of information I learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My personal site had always been a portfolio site.
